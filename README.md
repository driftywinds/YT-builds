# Youtube Revanced (including forks) builds releases
Repository for the releases of Youtube ReVanced builds compiled from YT-Advanced's rvx-builder with custom branding for identification. This tool can be found at: - https://github.com/YT-Advanced/rvx-builder

The options.json file has been altered for custom branding but all credits go to inotia00 for the original ReVanced Extended patches and YT-Advanced for the fork that keep the patches updated. I simply compile builds and release them here for convinience, please do not file issues because I will not be able to solve them.
