~~F.A.Q. available here - https://pastebin.com/raw/HB2eB96F OR https://wbin.003274.xyz/doc/vhqqemsf~~ This is deprecated, I will make a new one.

The options.json file has been altered for custom branding but all credits go to inotia00 and the ReVanced Team for the original ReVanced and ReVanced Extended patches. I simply compile builds and release them here for convinience, please do not file issues because I will not be able to solve them.

NOTE: - These builds can be installed alongside any other build of YT ReVanced since the package name is unique to my builds. This means that you will not have to uninstall any other version of YT ReVanced you have installed already and can simultaneously use both my build and any other version you have installed.

Remember the best way to get the ReVanced apks are to compile them yourself, but if you are unable to do that yourself, you can use my builds. I use the manager and compile as soon as new updates become available, but this process elicits implicit trust. 

Finally, under no circumstance do I mean to not credit the original author of the patches, integrations and the builder [inotia00](https://github.com/inotia00) and the authors of the original patches [ReVanced Team](https://github.com/ReVanced) who have put in their hardwork to establish this pipeline for the masses. My goal is to provide the builds in good faith for people who are unable to do so themselves as I had been privately doing for friends and family already.
