# Youtube Revanced (including forks) builds releases
Repository for the releases of Youtube ReVanced builds compiled from YT-Advanced's rvx-builder with custom branding for identification. This tool can be found at: - https://github.com/YT-Advanced/rvx-builder

The options.json file has been altered for custom branding but all credits go to inotia00 for the original ReVanced Extended patches and YT-Advanced for the fork that keep the patches updated. I simply compile builds and release them here for convinience, please do not file issues because I will not be able to solve them.

Remember the best way to get the ReVanced apks are to compile them yourself, but if you are unable to do that yourself, you can use my builds. I simply use the manager and compile as soon as new updates become available, but this process elicits implicit trust. 

Finally, under no circumstance do I mean to not credit the original author of the patches, integrations and the builder [YT-Advanced](https://github.com/YT-Advanced) and the author of the original patches [inotia00](https://github.com/inotia00) who have put in their hardwork to establish this pipeline for the masses. My goal is to provide the builds in good faith for people who are unable to do so themselves as I had been privately doing for friends and family already.
